## Summary and Requirements:
  This repository contains custom Matlab scriptes needed to produce key results in the manuscript.
## Test Environment(s):
MATLAB version: R2020a  Python Version: 3.6  Operating System: windows 10, linux centos6_x86_64

## behavioral analyses
  * data for behavioral performance for each subject
  
    script: behavioral.mat

## Fmri data analysis

### Bayesian switcing dynamical systems （Figure 1）
  * conduct BSDS modeling for episodic memory related ROIs.
  
    script: Fig_1.m
  
    
### Decoded brain state characterization (Figure 2)
  * mean amplitude, functional conn as well as network structure analyses
  
    script: Fig_2.m
  
### State-behavior correlation analyses(Figure 3)
  * Brain state dynamic metrics: occupancy rate, mean life as well as transitions
  
    script: Fig_3.m
  
    Figures in the MS: Figure.2A plotted by python; Figure.2B,2C,2D,2E plotted by MATLAB
### Decoding pre and post-rest brain state dynamics (Figure 4)
  * Decoding pre and post rest brain state dynmaics
  
    script: Fig_4.m
